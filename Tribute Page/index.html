          <li><strong>1873</strong> - Finished a four-year term in three years</li>
          <li><strong>1875</strong> - Enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz, worked hard and earned the highest grades possible.</li>
          <li><strong>1878</strong> - Was failing in school and leaves Graz.  </li>
          <li><strong>1879</strong> - Taught a large class of students in his old school in Gospić.</li>
          <li><strong>1881</strong> - Moved to Budapest, Hungary to work at a telegraph company as the chief eletrician.</li>
          <li><strong>1882</strong> - Got another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.</li>
          <li><strong>1884</strong> - Emigrated to United States and began working at the Edison Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side.</li>
          <li><strong>1891</strong> - Became a naturalized citizen of the United States, and patented his Tesla coil. He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system and conducted a series of public demonstrations wuere he lit Geissler tubes and incandescent light bulbs from across a stage.</li>
          <li><strong>1892</strong> - Served as vice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers until the year of 1894.</li>
          <li><strong>1893</strong> - Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls.</li>
          <li><strong>1894</strong> - Began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of "invisible" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as "Roentgen rays" or "X-rays").</li>
          <li><strong>1895</strong> -  The South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces.</li>
          <li><strong>1898</strong> -  Tried to sell his idea to the US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest.</li>
          <li><strong>1906</strong> - Since 1890, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires.</li>
          <li><strong>1915</strong> - On 6 November, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg "for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays".</li>
          <li><strong>1917</strong> - Postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an "electric ray" of "tremendous frequency," with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar).</li>
          <li><strong>1943</strong> - On 7 January, at the age of 86, died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker.</li>
        </ul>
